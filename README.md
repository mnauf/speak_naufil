This program allows you to spam on your friend's chat. When you execute the program, it automnatically opens chrome with whatsapp website on it. You have to scan the code with your mobile whatsapp and you will be logged into it. Besides, opening chrome, it also opens a blakc window. It asks for the name you have saved your friend's name with and 'HOW MANY COUNT" means from 0 to what counting do you want to send him. For instance you press 10. So the next line appears "WAIT FOR ENTER". Press any key and it will start sending counting one by one to your victim/friend.

Don't worry if on downloading, it says the file might harm your computer. 
Note: Only works with Chrome
